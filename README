In short, this is a quantum annealing (QA) repo. It contains
various code that I have found useful in my own QA research starting in Summer
2018 at Oak Ridge National Lab and continuing on into the present at my under-
grad instituion, Mississippi State University. It's purpose/ functionaity is
best understood by discussing it in four parts: probrep, dwave, numerics, and
simuatlions.

ProbRep (and really, DictRep)
==============================
Since people from different backgrounds are all interested in QA, they tend to
encode their problems differently. The idea behind the ProbRep class is to
capture this notion in an abstract base class, or ABC for short. As an ABC,
this class ensures that any valid encoding implementation has support for all
the operations a researcher would be interested in, i.e. running the problem
on D-Wave, performing numerical diagonzlation, etc...

DictRep is a bona-fide class I've designed to handle my own encoding scheme:
Hamiltonians as dictionaries. It contains a large number of methods that I've
designed as they were needed. Truthfully, it could use some organization...

Dwave
==============================
This contains utilities for connecting to D-Wave and running problems on
D-Wave chips. For example, this has a utility for creating D-Wave anneal
schedules with a simpler input syntax than that desired by their API.

Numerics
==============================
This contains a bunch of code to allow for numeric computations such as
diagonalization, numeric quantum annealing that emulates the D-wave process,
and more.

Simulations
==============================
Using the Dwave and Numerics utilities, it is often natural to design
various simulations/ experiments to test ideas. For example, one such idea
is forward-reverse error-mitigation (FREM) annealing that I am currently
researching.
