This contains quantum annealing (QA) code that I have used in my research
of forward-reverse error mitigation (FREM) annealing at Mississippi State
with Dr. Mark Novotny.

The basic idea of FREM can be understood in Examples/frem.py. This also goes
into detail about the underlying algorithm. The basic workflow of our
simulations can be understood in Examples/workflow.py and in
Simulations/sidon_frem_sim.py. 

If you take a look at the commit history, you will see that this code has
undergone many drastic overhauls. This has been for many reasons. At first,
this code was intended to provide a means to run D-Wave experiments and
numerical experiments seamlessly on a single Hamiltonian. However, this
turned out to not work so well due to some conflicts between QuTiP and
D-Wave's Ocean, and since FREM was a more promising research direction,
I ultimately decided to abandon the D-Wave portion for now.

However, I ultimately would like to add it back, but only time will tell...
